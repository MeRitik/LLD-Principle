>The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that each software module should have one and only one reason to change.


> Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons.

- If you think about this youâ€™ll realize that this is just another way to define cohesion and coupling. We want to increase the cohesion between things that change for the same reasons, and we want to decrease the coupling between those things that change for different reasons.
